{"text": "###USER: Hey! Watching movies is one of my favorite pastimes.###ASSISTANT: generally speaking what type of movies do you watch###USER: I like thrillers a lot.###ASSISTANT: thrillers? for example?###USER: Zodiac's one of my favorite movies.###USER: Zodiac the movie about a serial killer from the '60s or '70s, around there.###ASSISTANT: Zodiac? oh wow ok, what do you like about that movie###USER: And I just think serial killers, in general, are interesting, so the movie was really good. And it was just neat to see that world. Like it went really in-depth. It was like almost 3 hours long, so you got to really feel like you were a part of that world and time period. And see what the detectives and the police did and the investigators.###ASSISTANT: so you feel like you were part of that world ?###USER: Yeah. It was really an immersive movie.###ASSISTANT: if you were in the movie what character do you feel most relatable###USER: Probably the main character, Robert Graysmith, just cuz he's awkward and bumbly. So, I guess that's the one I would be the closest to.###ASSISTANT: what scene do you like the best###USER: Probably the most memorable one is the murder at the lake. Just cuz it's really vivid and horrific to watch. But it's very memorable.###ASSISTANT: ok nice, any other similiar movies you have seen recently?###USER: Not that I can think of.###ASSISTANT: how about different type of movies like Once Upon a Deadpool###USER: I haven't seen that.###ASSISTANT: have you heard of that movie###USER: I've heard of it, but I haven't seen it.###ASSISTANT: would you be interested to watch it###USER: Not particularly. I don't really like comic book movies that much. But I really wanted to see Deadpool, so I'd probably be more willing to watch that than most comic book movies.###ASSISTANT: oh what makes deadpool different than the others?###USER: I don't know. It just seems a unique concept and different, not just the standard superhero movie.###USER: And it's more of a comedy, so that's unique.###ASSISTANT: ok so you enjoy comedy as well, correct?###USER: Yep, I think most people do.###ASSISTANT: what type of movie you don't enjoy?###USER: I'm not a big action movie fan like Die Hard or like Rambo movies. I don't hate them, I just think they're boring. Like I can't watch a lot of them, or else I get sick of them.###ASSISTANT: what about mission impossible?###USER: Never seen it. I know what it is, but I haven't seen it.###ASSISTANT: do you care who acts in the movie?###USER: Just in general? I'm not I'm not picky about actors. Like I won't see a movie just cuz I don't like the actor in it.###ASSISTANT: oh ok so you dont have a favorite actor is that right###USER: I mean I like certain actors more than others, but I wouldn't say I have a favorite actor.###ASSISTANT: ok who came to your mind when it comes to actors you like to see in the movie###ASSISTANT: what is your favorite Tom Hanks movie?###USER: Catch Me If You Can###ASSISTANT: what so great about that movie###USER: It's just an interesting story and it's based on a true story and it's got Leonardo Dicaprio in it, another good actor.###ASSISTANT: do you think that movie is exciting?###USER: Yep.###ASSISTANT: which scene you find most memorable?###USER: It's been a long time since I've seen that movie. I can't think of any specific scene."}

I'll watch that. Or I'll turn to that. I probably won't be there for too long. It ended up being a ton of fun.###USER: It was like a new version of Die Hard. They had a lot of fun with the movie.

It really did seem like an event movie, and maybe if I had seen it in the theater, I would have sort of fallen in love with it like other people did, but###USER: It just It was underwhelming. The direction wasn't nearly as good as I thought it was going to be and I just thought it was going to be something more exciting and more appealing that it ended up being for me.###ASSISTANT: Have you seen John Wick?###USER: No, but I know I know what that movie is, yeah.###ASSISTANT: Have you seen Halloween?###USER: I mean, sure.###ASSISTANT: What do you like about the Halloween movies?###USER: I don't like the Halloween movies.

Too scary.###USER: and outside of the first one. And apparently I ha I haven't seen up the most recent one that is sort of a direct sequel to the first one.

I like to just be able to enjoy it. And for the most part, a scary movie will literally scare me, possibly cause nightmares, so it's not something that I typically go into enjoying. It's something I go into with trepidation. So it sort of defeats the purpose. I I consider movies an enjoyment, so it really does defeat the purpose for me to be watching a scary movie.###ASSISTANT: Is there a specific movie that you heavily dislike?###ASSISTANT: What do you dislike about this movie?###USER: So Olympus has Fallen is a action film that is around the white house that's not particularly good and it takes itself way too seriously. So even if it was decent enough it's not realistic enough for it to be taken as seriously as it was taking itself. So, it doesn't really work. I I completely confused the cast. The supporting cast is better than the leaders.###ASSISTANT: Have you seen Black Panther?###USER: I have.###ASSISTANT: What did you like or dislike about this title?###USER: Black Panther is excellent. It's fantastic that it was a black cast, African American cast that is a superhero. It's just never They never have done it before. So it was refreshing. It was great to see. It was inspiring to see, and the movie was actually great. It wasn't even like it was some sort of a downgrade. It was an upgrade for superhero movies.###USER: So, the the acting is fantastic, the story line fantastic, it was all around excellent movie.###ASSISTANT: It's definitely nice to see something new that is uplifting for people###USER: Yes.###ASSISTANT: Thank you for your time and have a great day! Bye!###USER: Thanks. You, too."}

It had good action. That was basically all it had going for it, but even then, it just It just wasn't great. It was I think the wrong setting.

But they're always very simple stories with a little bit There's almost###USER: It's always action in there somewhere, and they are they are kind of relaxing to watch as well.

It's very formulated kind of I guess I've just kind of bored by the formula, but if they focus more on the comedy, I like it. I like them more.###ASSISTANT: What didn't you like about that kind of film?###USER: Kind of was saying that the they very formulaic. They they don't necessarily take chances, you know what's coming.

First, at least that mean obviously for the science fiction genre. But it's a way to I can really lose myself in the stories and the excitement whereas the genres I don't like###USER: For musicals there's not much plot usually, and I don't like the way stories are told through the music. I feel like it loses the point. It's not something that I enjoy. I don't like the songs usually and###USER: I think that's what most people like about those movies.###ASSISTANT: can you name a movie that you liked a lot?###USER: Let's see.###USER: Well, recently just cuz it the third one just came out but the and I didn't really say it but animated movies like Pixar-type movies How to Train Your Dragon, that series is a underappreciated series I think in comparison to like Toy Story and other Pixar movies. Toy Story would also be up there for me in terms of movies I like or a movie series I like.###ASSISTANT: nice. how about a movie that you didn't like. can you name one?###USER: I want to say it's called It's kind a bit of musical. Across the Universe or it's the one where I forgotten the name. It's something with universe, and I think it's Beatles reference, because all the songs in the movie are Beatles songs. But, it's like a romantic story or something.###USER: Which also, I don't really like romantic comedies. I'm not sure it's a comedy, but it's definitely a musical. And I I just But name a musical, and I I probably do not like it. Little Shop Horrors, I didn't like. Though, parts of it, I kind of liked. I liked the plot of it. I just didn't like the music of it.###ASSISTANT: got it, so no musicals, even if it's about the beatles!###USER: That's right. I like The Beatles music but not in a movie form. I think it's just repetition of it. It gets tiresome. Like if there's one song or two songs in the movie, maybe I can that's fine. But when it's like every 5-10 minutes or whatever, it breaks down to it gets tiresome. But I also don't like to listen to the same type of music. Like I don't listen###USER: to a whole album because I get bored by the end of it. So, it's probably just my preferences or you know.###ASSISTANT: have you seen pulp fiction?###USER: Yes, its it it will be on it would be up there in terms of one of my favorite movies.###ASSISTANT: nice! what did you like about it?###USER: Well, definitely for the time that it came out, it was so unique, that nonlinear kind of storytelling narrative that is a little bit more commonplace now. Though you don't see it too often. But it it was the It was that Tarantino mix of like ultra-violence, unpredictability, great dialog, and you just never###USER: I think the whole movie is kind of like that."}

I don't like every single drama but I do like that that they can take sort of a slice of life and make something special out of it. Dramas are usually the most realistic and the most ordinary type of movies that you can go and see. So, there are makers who can make something special out of sort of an ordinary is quite an accomplishment and enjoyable to watch.###ASSISTANT: Can you name a particular movie that you like?###USER: Sure.

And the other thing is that it just###USER: It's It's so such a over hyped movie and it's just, I don't know, ordinary. It's not something that's overly enjoyable and it's nothing that you want to keep watching over and over again. It having a good soundtrack or two likable characters out of, I don't know, a hundred isn't something that you should should get loaded over so much.###ASSISTANT: Do you like the movie Insurgent?###USER: I do.###ASSISTANT: What do you like about this movie?

It was very enjoyable.###ASSISTANT: Do you like the movie Interstellar ?###USER: I haven't seen Interstellar.###ASSISTANT: Have you heard of this movie?###USER: I have.###ASSISTANT: Would you go see it?###USER: I would, but it's probably something that I would It's more likely that I would see with a friend who wanted to see it more than I did.###ASSISTANT: Do you like the movie Solo: A Star Wars Story?###USER: Yeah, I I like Star Wars movies. Yes.###ASSISTANT: What do you like about this movie? Please give me 2 reasons.###USER: Sure. It is Star Wars mythology and the world that they create is really something special, and this definitely continues that. The other thing is that it's just It's quite a world that they've created, so it's exciting.

It's a lot to follow, but it is enjoyable.###ASSISTANT: Do you like the movie Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice ?###USER: It's not my favorite. No.###ASSISTANT: Why do you dislike this movie? Please give 2 reasons.###USER: Sure. I think it was poorly thought out. I think the So I think it was poorly thought out, and the writing, because it was poorly thought out, suffered. Like they didn't They knew they were trying to do a movie that included both characters, so they were trying for something interesting, but they didn't have anything that really connected them that warranted making a movie.###ASSISTANT: Thank you for your feedback.

And the romance is always fun to watch develop and play out. I really like the lightheartedness and the comedy of the movies. I There's sort of enough bad things going on in the world, that I don't need to watch a ton of it in a movie. So, I like lighter, funnier comedies, and romantic comedies are my favorite kind of###ASSISTANT: thanks so much. how about a movie that fits that movie category that u didnt like, and describe what factors you didn't like about that type of movie.###USER: Sure. So like Love Adores is a easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. It is It has actually a very good cast, but the script and whatever they are trying to do in a movie is so flawed. That one is an approach where they have two women who are sort of friends and they are traveling together and they're###USER: embarking on sort of a new part of their life, but to say it doesn't work is an understatement. It's It's very bizarre. It sort of starts as like a romantic comedy and turns into a bit of a thriller, which It's based on a book, and I never read the book, so I don't think that's how the book turns out, but it's completely unexpected and not how they sold the movie. And So that was bad writing, really bad directing, and just a bad idea in general, despite having###USER: Sort of a well known and trustworthy cast to pull it off, but you can't pull off something that's this bad.###ASSISTANT: thanks for the description on why you didn't like that movie type. have you seen the movie to all the boys i've loved before###USER: I have.###ASSISTANT: did you like that kind of movie###USER: I love that kind of movie.###ASSISTANT: why is that###USER: That's more like a teen movie, another favorite genre of mine. I love teen movies. They are sort of like They actually are almost, in many ways, either a mini comedy or a mini romantic comedy. Except, because they're teen-focused, they are even more simplistic, because they, you know, they're young, they only have so many things going on, you know, it'll be it's like sort of, you know, their problems are limited to###USER: Mostly boys' school, girls', maybe getting into college, that kind of thing. But, they don't have a a ton of real life problems going on. So, it's pretty simple. And So But, there's still a lot you can do. And it's good for the audience because we all had to go through that time, so it's something easy to look back and laugh on. But, yeah. In the movie in particular, unknown to me, the girl who stars in it was really good. And really the###USER: The movie felt really original, so it was a welcome surprise."}

There is no real harp in it, but they do sing like Home Sweet Home. It's a period piece, it's really gorgeously done. I thought it was really good. It's dubbed in English. It's not dubbed like it has subtitles in English. I think it's spoken in Japanese.###ASSISTANT: what did you think of the ending?###USER: The ending, oh, the ending was was really good. Like, I think he goes home. I don't think there's like a love interest in the story per se. It's about war, you know, it's about war. And he goes on this beach once.

So it's really an experience you are not going to be you can really embrace yourself and and not think, \"Oh, this is real life and it's about to happen.\" So it's it could be a lot of fun, very exciting###USER: And sort of a real thing you can immerse yourself in for a few hours.###ASSISTANT: Can you name a particular movie that you like?###USER: Sure. I love Bourne Ultimatum.###ASSISTANT: Can you give me a couple of reasons why you like this movie?###USER: Sure. Bourne Ultimatum is a excellent movie on literally every front. It is a excellent acting, excellent writing, excellent direction. The direction is usually overlooked but the directing is phenomenal and it helps make the movie absolutely perfect. It is a very tight movie. There is barely a a a second that is wasted.###USER: and I don't know. Let's say the movie is like 2 hours or 2 hours and 20 minutes or something. It feels like it goes by so quickly because it's just It has such a rhythm to it, and you're just immersed and involved with what's going on. And it's a character you can root for, and just people you like And this is a continuing series, so you really know the character already, and you're really there to root them on.###ASSISTANT: Can you name a movie that you do not like?###USER: Yes, unlike so many I did not like Dark Knight.###ASSISTANT: What do you dislike about this movie? Please give me 2 reasons.###USER: Sure, Dark Knight is a Batman movie, and Batman already had an original, and it's so the problem of Dark Knight for me is is not true to the comic, and we saw a movie that was great and true to the comic. So, I don't like the joker character, it's not that bad. Keith Ledger was bad as the joker necessarily, not exactly, it's that it was not written very poorly. It was so dark.###USER: So the two things I really don't like are it wasn't funny which is what the joke was supposed to be and the writing was extremely disappointing and very dark so just it was a a just bad all around for me.###ASSISTANT: Do you like the movie Guardians of the Galaxy?###USER: That's not a movie I have seen, but it's the kind of movie that I would like, that's a superhero movie.###ASSISTANT: Do you like the movie The Purge?###USER: Oh God!

Maybe it makes you think it's going to end one way and then ends the other. I like The Sixth Sense or that Gone Girl was pretty good, even though it was kind of###USER: It was kind of easy to tell it was going, but it was still still pretty good. Also trying to think of another one.###ASSISTANT: Is there a particular film you enjoy?###USER: Yeah, The Usual Suspects, because Mainly because I really When I watched it the first time, it's one of those movies that you can't really I mean, you can watch it more than once, but you The first time you watch, you won't know the twist, so it really kind of grabs you. And with that one, I really didn't have any clue. I mean, usually you might have some kind of inkling of what's going to happen, but with that movie to me, it just really kind of grabbed me, and I was like, man###USER: It left me kind of speechless at the end.###ASSISTANT: What did you like about that film?###USER: I liked that I didn't I couldn't predict the ending of it.

It's nothing really particularly You know, not any one particular thing. To me, they were just kind of boring and I don't know.

If it is, I haven't seen it. I think I saw the preview for it at something I went to not too long ago. Yeah, it's not generally something I would probably go to the movies and see.

I don't really like the story telling they're doing with that cuz it's not the same as how they were written back in the '60s like in the actual comic books some of the superhero movies. I don't like reboots. Like they keep rebooting Spider-Man###USER: And I mean it's cool that they're doing that, but I just I just don't like that they're changing up the characters like they're changing the race. I mean I get that there are social quality and going on and, you know, they want people all to be accepted by their change in their character that's in a comic book. There could be a white character changing into a girl, it could be a gender change, or it could be a racial change.

I thought John Travolta did good in it, Samuel Jackson was all right. I think I saw it maybe a couple times. A lot of people say it's a cool classic.

There's usually It's usually quite an escape to watch an action film.###ASSISTANT: nice. can you name a movie that you really liked?###USER: Mr. & Mrs. Smith is one of my favorite action films. It's a It's Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie and so great cast and this particular action film great cast, great action, great writing with sexual aroma that's paired into it which I really love and it has a lot of great back and forth a really great script which does not always###USER: when you have a great script in action movie, it does make it that much better.###ASSISTANT: what kind of movies do you dislike?###USER: I don't like horror films.###ASSISTANT: what do you dislike about them?###USER: I don't like scaring myself.

I just don't watch them.###ASSISTANT: in general###USER: and into this day. It was one of the most baffling movies I've ever watched from what it was supposed to be and what it ended up being. It was terrible.###ASSISTANT: so the acting was good but the story was bad?###USER: I wouldn't say the acting was good, but it did have good actors in it. There was nothing really good about the movie.###USER: But the actors are known quantities who are in it, so I wouldn't blame it on the acting. It wasn't there were The actors sort of who are in it are They're award-winning actors, so it was really not the acting.###ASSISTANT: i see. have you seen The Favourite?###USER: No, I have not.###USER: I know the movie but I haven't seen it.###ASSISTANT: how about la la land?###USER: Yes.###ASSISTANT: what did you think about this movie?###USER: I thought in a vacuum, it was a good movie. If looking at it just strictly as a If you take exactly what they're doing onscreen, I think it's a very charming, likable movie. Stepping away from it, I think there's a lot of flaws to the movie. There is it's an incredibly white, Caucasian movie for a movie to be about jazz, and be almost completely white, Caucasian is ridiculous.###USER: There's the one black guy in it. They have the white guy telling the black guy about jazz, so a lot of things about it don't ring true, but if you are just watching the film and trying to enjoy it for what they put on the screen, it's a very likable movie."}

The writing is very clever, it's a very original, it's also a little more out there. I like more absurd humor, and this has parts of that in it. And it's It was a movie that was more traditionally would have been something that starred men.###USER: So it was special that it starred women."}

It is not overdone, so it's not trying too hard to go I think into sort of trying too hard to be funny is just sort of is funny the way it's written which is one of its true strengths.

I just love it.###ASSISTANT: ok so what is the differences between adam's newer movies to his older ones###USER: His newer movies lack the comedic output as his older ones. His older ones have almost all original ideas, and his newer ones are seems like it's more made for, you know, like a family environment, like a family comedy rather than, you know, adult comedy. Or just stupid stupid comedy, so###ASSISTANT: ah ok, so its more family oriented now, do you think he lost his touch?###USER: Well, he's still funny. He's just not as funny as he used to be. So, he might have lost a little bit of it, but still he's movies is still entertaining, but just not as much as so.###ASSISTANT: gotcha, so he is still a good comedian ,what about other movies you enjoy###ASSISTANT: thats not funny###USER: I like the Sci-Fi movie called Event Horizon.###USER: If I had a choice between any movie I want, I would probably pick a sci-fi movie like Event Horizon or one of the newer Star Trek movies.###ASSISTANT: ah ok, cool. lets talk about movies you dont like###USER: Okay.

And their stories are pretty repetitive.###ASSISTANT: would you be ok with romantic elements in movies like star trek or star wars?###USER: No, I think those scenes are also a waste of time.###ASSISTANT: gotcha, so what scenes you think worth the time and money###USER: Well, like I said, it non-romance scenes is is worth the time and money. Like any scene that, you know, actively moves the story along rather than, you know, normal scenes that just are there just to waste time.###ASSISTANT: ok any scenes that are active and comical is fine###ASSISTANT: is that right###USER: Yeah."}

They are sort of very involved and fun and, I don't know, hearing music is always an enjoyable aspect to sort of this kind of experience. It's kind of like stage coming to a movie.###USER: And this one was particularly well cast and well-thought-out, I think in a way to be endearing, while not trying to compete with the original.###ASSISTANT: that's a great way to describe musical experiences. thanks for sharing your perspective. i appreciate it"}

There's super cool archival footage in there. The interviews are really good. It was really sort of compelling as well because like it's co-star, the police the policemen on the show, are actually gay.###USER: Mr. Rogers was an evangelist who would not normally support gay people, but he said like The gay guy said like he was a He was a He was father figure to me.

Very much.###ASSISTANT: And again, it'd be great to hear why you enjoy that type of movie###USER: I love the female lead. I love the action. I like superhero.

It's older. It's very interesting to see how they thought the future would look back then. It It's gotten I should really rewatch it now that I think about it cuz I rewatched I watched the the sequel, which was okay, but not too great.###ASSISTANT: what didn't you like about the sequel?###USER: The original movie had a specific ambiance. I guess it's hard to explain. It felt like you're part of a world that was woven by the director. The new one just felt like it was an action movie.###USER: And there wasn't there wasn't that much. It felt like it was kind of drab. Let me put it that way.###ASSISTANT: do you like how the first one has a more noir style?###USER: Yes, I think I think that's all right. I think that's exactly it."}

And I really liked it.###ASSISTANT: What did you enjoy about it ?###USER: I thought it was so funny and I thought that I wouldn't enjoy it because the stars of the movie were all unknown, but it didn't matter.

Movies always manage to capture my attention.###ASSISTANT: Do you like movies like the Spotlight?###USER: Yeah, for the most part I do like movies like Spotlight.###ASSISTANT: Ok. What is it about this type of movie that you like?###USER: It's a controversial topic that is covering and it's trying to send a message about what they're doing now. It depicted a preachiness I think because that's what the journalists were doing but still came off a little bit that way but a really great movie and it doesn't take away from it. It's just a little bit I I still would put all the president's men of those kinds of movies ahead of spotlight one of the reasons because of that.###ASSISTANT: Do you like movies like Inside Man?###USER: I don't know that movie.###ASSISTANT: Do you like movies like Good Will Hunting?###USER: Love Good Will Hunting.###ASSISTANT: Ok. What is it about this type of movie that you like?###USER: Well, for this particular movie, the cast was perfect. Now you got the cast to be perfect because of the involvement of the actors in making the film, otherwise they would have gone for bigger names at the time, and a different cast, and it wouldn't have been such a good movie. That they came off as authentic to the Boston area was an important part of the movie. The script is great. The actors are excellent.###USER: It's believable, and also really hopeful. They're original story, which is amazing. Really an amazing story that they came up with. And But also had moments of lightness to it that help balance out sort of the more serious journey that the movie takes you on.###ASSISTANT: Can you say a little more about that please?###USER: Sure, the movie itself is rather serious. It's taking, you know, a guy who was sort of ordinary and not making a ton of money to being someone who everybody wanted sort of a piece of to study because his mind was so amazing, and it had been discovered. So it's a very serious movie, but him dating Minnie Driver's character, his involvement###USER: storyline with Robin Williams is extremely serious, given his background. Yet, the times with his friends, with Minnie, with Robin, where there's a few lighter moments that have to balance out the movie into a much more well-rounded movie than it otherwise would have been.###ASSISTANT: Do you like movies like When Harry Met Sally?###USER: Love When Harry Met Sally. Love it.###ASSISTANT: Ok. What is it about this type of movie that you like?###USER: Well, first of all, it's a romantic comedy, which is my favorite genre. When Harry Met Sally itself is###USER: Exceptional in that it doesn't try to do too much except what they are trying to do. They are two actors who are really they are focused on mostly on the two actors and then the four actors. They do it so well, the script is absolutely amazing, the direction is fantastic, it really doesn't try to be more than it is and it's totally charming and you can watch it a million times.###ASSISTANT: Can you say a little more about that please?###USER: Sure. Some of the best movies ever made are fantastic, but you don't always want to watch them over and over and over again. When Harry Met Sally is the kind of movie that is fantastic, and as a romantic comedy, a little more approachable, a little more likable, and it's something you can watch many many times over the years. I've seen that more times than I can count, and even though I know what's going to happen, it's enjoyable every time.###ASSISTANT: Thank you for another most insightful critique. Have a nice weekend.###USER: You, too."}

I like them because they have They seem to always really get get really good actors, and I just like comic books in general, and then the themes that the they use in the movies, and the production value of them is generally top notch, especially the Marvel ones.###ASSISTANT: Is there a specific movie you enjoy from this genre?###USER: I really like the the Iron Man ones, the very first one especially, and the second one was really good. But I guess right now probably The Avengers. That series is just really good. The last one wasn't quite as good as the first two, but I hear good things about the second one, or the next one that's coming out, so I can't wait to see that one.###ASSISTANT: Are there any type of movies that you don't enjoy?###USER: I am not a big horror fan. Lot of people like that like the Purge movies or I don't know, The House on Haunted Hill. I can't really think of a lot of the names cuz to me, they all just kind of sound the same, but It's not to say I won't watch one, but I just don't actively It'd probably be more one that I would maybe rent at rent at Redbox or watch at Netflix. It's not something that I would go be waiting on a Friday night###ASSISTANT: Is there a specific movie that you heavily dislike?###USER: No, not really a specific movie. Generally, if I don't like something, I just don't watch it. So I would have to to really dislike something, I would have to watch it all the way through. To me, if it's not If it's not any good in the first 15 or 20 minutes, I'll just stop watching or do something else. And I'm generally pretty good The movies that I go to the movies to see You know, I try to make sure that they're going to be really good and worth###USER: Worth watching before, so I don't have to like walk out of the movies or anything. But if it's something that I've rented or try to watch on Netflix it's no good, after about 10 to 15 minutes, I'll just switch.###ASSISTANT: Have you seen Black Panther###USER: Yeah, I have some. That one was really good. I'll probably put that on my list of the best of the modern series.###ASSISTANT: What did you enjoy or not enjoy about this movie?###USER: I just enjoyed pretty much everything. I liked the story. It was neat the way they did it. I've never I was never a Black Panther comic book fan. I don't even think I might have one maybe with him in it, but I think it was with him and somebody else. But so it's not like a comic book character that I thought I wasn't sure if I would enjoy the movie, but it was very surprising cuz it was probably one of the best the best Marvel movies they've done so far,###USER: clear with the very first time Iron Man.###ASSISTANT: Thank you for your help and have a wonderful day!"}
{"text": "###USER: Hey! I really enjoy watching movies.###ASSISTANT: What types of movies do you usually see?###USER: I usually see comedies, action movies, superhero movies, teen movies, occasionally dramas or suspense movies.###ASSISTANT: ok. Tell me one of your favorite movies.###USER: The pretty Pretty Woman is one of my favorite movies.###ASSISTANT: Great. Why did you like it?###USER: Pretty Woman is sort of a I think it gets billed as a romantic comedy, but it's much more of a romantic comedy drama. It has a lot of dramatic points to it. The pairing of Julia Roberts and Richard Gere is pitch-perfect, and it's one of the best pairings to like every grace the big screen. So the writing on the movie is fantastic.###USER: the interactions\u00a0between the characters especially Julia and Richard are what really make the movie and it's it's a wonderful it's a funny endearing movie.###ASSISTANT: Alright. Can you name a bad movie?###USER: Sure. The Ugly Truth is a bad movie.###ASSISTANT: What was so bad about it?###USER: Where to begin? It was billed as a like when it was promoted on commercials and start it was builled as a romantic comedy. It is not. It is It All it has a star of a man and a woman who were supposedly supposed to be in a romance . It's more of a gross out comedy, sort of a shock comedy. It had gross out humor. It had a lot of###USER: rudeness and juvenile behavior. It was really bizarre what they were going for. I usually like Katherine Heigl, this was not a good movie. And her co-star in it, Gerard Butler, he is highly overrated. I don't know how he keeps getting these starring roles.###ASSISTANT: Got it. Have you seen Bridesmaids?###USER: Yes, I have.###ASSISTANT: ok. What did you like about it?###USER: Bridesmaids is a great movie, funny, really well written, really well acted, and it's a little more original. It's sort of a but had a lot of laugh out loud humor and it had little more shocking humor at times, a little more###USER: Graphic humor at times but with a female leading cast and that's being extremely rare in movies. So, it was a really refreshing movie but just a really a very funny one.###ASSISTANT: Okay, so have you seen Searching?###USER: No, I don't think so.###USER: No, I haven't seen it.###ASSISTANT: How about Skyscraper?###USER: I think that might be a recent one maybe with The Rock. I have not seen that.###ASSISTANT: do you plan to see it?###USER: That's the one that I would watch if it came on TV, yeah, I would I would watch that one. It's I think it's just it's just like a general action movie like sort of action adventure. So, yeah, that one I'd watch.###ASSISTANT: okay, how about Nocturnal animals?###USER: Oh god, no.###ASSISTANT: why not?###USER: If I remember correctly, that is one of two things. That is either a scarier movie or a sort of a dramatic movie that has extremely that has a lot of darkness to it, sort of like verging on being a Quentin Tarantino movie. So probably something I'm not going to watch. It would have to be like an Oscar contending me for me to want to see that kind of a movie.###ASSISTANT: so you don't like that type of movie?###USER: It's not my favorite. It doesn't mean I'll never I wouldn't I wouldn't watch it but it would have to be get like excellent reviews. It would have to be considered, you know, really critically acclaimed for me to probably watch a movie like that.###ASSISTANT: okay. thank you for your time.###USER: You're welcome."}

And sometimes animation if they fit right with my personal liking.###ASSISTANT: what do you like about these kinds of movies?###USER: Animation you could do a whole bunch of stuff that you cannot do with live action. Sometimes CGI is never the best option and the best way to go about like impossible stuff is do it in animation because the idea's limitless on what you can do.###ASSISTANT: can you name a movie that you really liked?###USER: Last movie I really liked was Justice League.###ASSISTANT: what did you like about this movie?###USER: Even though they give bad stuff about the bad CGI in the movie, it's still a guilty pleasure of mine. I'm a real DC fan even though Marvel is good, but I still enjoy DC a lot more cuz their heroes and are a lot more and have more character to them. It was great seeing Batman played by Ben Affleck be pretty great. Superman was really good.###USER: Wonder Woman was enjoyable, and the introduction of Aquaman and Cyborg and Flash really made the movie interesting to watch.

They're not my go to at all, I wouldn't watch one.###ASSISTANT: what do you dislike about them?###USER: I just don't like scary things in general. One, they give me nightmares sometimes. And I don't really like having nightmares because###USER: I sometimes forget they're dreams and cuz they like look so real sometimes.###USER: And probably like the realism of horror movies is what gets me. Cuz there are sometimes like I feel like when I'm home alone, something might happen to me when I don't want it to.###ASSISTANT: can you name a movie that you didn't like?###USER: Last movie I did not like was I'm trying to remember.###USER: Hm.###USER: I did not like X-Men: Days of Future Past at all.###ASSISTANT: what did you dislike about it?###USER: I just didn't like the reboot of the X-Men. I think if they wanted to do more with the X-Men, they should've just went forward and ignored the first three first three movies, and added onto it with original characters like Wolverines, Cyclops, Patrick Stewart as the Professor.###USER: But yeah, I still like the move of making a brand-new trilogy for the X-Men. That's about it.###ASSISTANT: cool! have you seen inside out?###USER: No, I have not seen Inside Out. But I I have that on the list of what I want to watch.###ASSISTANT: ok, how about Bohemian Rhapsody?###USER: I have not seen it. But I want to see it because my uncle is a huge Queen fan.

I'd say Or maybe like A Quiet Place was the only one I can really think of cuz to be honest, when I see horror movies' advertisements, I just usually kind of tune them out.

Have you watched the movie Jason Bourne ?###USER: Yeah, I've seen those. The first couple. I didn't really stick with it.###USER: After the second one, where they killed his wife off, and they didn't do that at all in the books, I kind of stopped watching them. I might go back and watch them though, because it's been a while and I've reread the books since then, too. But I generally like that kind of movie, and it was a good movie. But it just ventured so far away from the books, and at the time, I had just finished reading the books when they came out, so after###USER: Well they killed her off early in the second movie and you know, in the book she really She stays on till the newer books came out. I don't know, it just kind of turned me off to them a little bit###USER: But I would definitely be up to going back and watching them now.###ASSISTANT: Alright.

I find joy in experiencing different movies.###ASSISTANT: What kind of movies do you like?###USER: I like a good action movie.###ASSISTANT: Like Mission Impossible?###USER: Love that series the the latest one, Fallout, is one one of the best action movies, I think, ever.###ASSISTANT: What did you like about it###USER: Well like I think most people probably, the stunts and how real they looked and knowing that Tom Cruise actually did them was part of why they were so exciting.###ASSISTANT: What parts didn't you like?###USER: Of Mission: Impossible? Well the stories are never that great. They're always kind of convoluted and hard to follow. But I thought the latest one was probably one of the better stories cuz it was pretty simple.###ASSISTANT: What movies do you stay away from?###USER: Oh. Well as a genre, usually kind of rom com, romantic comedies.###USER: I like comedies. And I don't mind the romantic things. I don't know. Maybe it's just all those movies seem to be the same movie. But, I don't know. I just don't typically like them very much.###ASSISTANT: Did you watch the Hunger Games series?###USER: I saw the first one, and I think the second one, but I didn't finish it, no.###ASSISTANT: What did you dislike about the first one?###USER: Maybe cuz it wasn't rated R. I don't know. It seemed like the premise of it deserved or required a more violent or harsher take, a more adult, and I think it felt like they like pulled their punches a little bit, and it also seemed like a story I'd kind of seen before.###USER: I don't know.###ASSISTANT: Have you seen Battle Royale?###USER: Yes, I think there's multiple like sequels maybe of them. But I haven't seen those. I've seen the first one though, the original one that Hunger Games is compared to a lot of times.###ASSISTANT: What did you like about Battle Royale?###USER: Well, it kind of I guess hits that note of you know it's the premise is dark it's you know kids or school age kids killing each other and it actually shows the violence of that. So like if you are going to go with that premise, go with that premise all the away. Don't Don't try to mitigate it with like a PG 13 rating or something like go all in or don't go all.###USER: I don't go at all, and I think that was probably the biggest difference in those two movies.###ASSISTANT: Thank you for your input, have a great day###USER: You, too."}

They're also really easy to watch.###ASSISTANT: That's awesome###ASSISTANT: Is there a specific movie you enjoy from this genre?###USER: Yeah, While You Were Sleeping is one of my favorites.###ASSISTANT: What did you like about this movie?###USER: It was an unexpected delight. It is extremely well acted and well written, but it's it's sort of an untraditional. It's not a traditional romantic comedy. It is sort of a romantic comedy paired with a family comedy, and it really works, but it's it's it's very endearing.###ASSISTANT: It's nice to see movies not follow a formula and go out of the box###USER: Yes, very true.###ASSISTANT: Are there any type of movies that you don't enjoy?###USER: I'm not the biggest fan of scary movies.###ASSISTANT: What about these movies is unappealing?###USER: I just don't enjoy being scared. It could It can cause me to have nightmares, so in order to actually watch a scary movie, I have to sort of remind myself that it's fake, which sort of takes away the point of watching it in the first place, so I usually just avoid them.###ASSISTANT: I can definitely understand that###ASSISTANT: Is there a specific movie that you heavily dislike?###USER: If that's a horror film###USER: Like Alien is a great movie, but not one I could ever watch.###ASSISTANT: What do you dislike about this movie?###USER: That'll give me nightmares.###USER: It has literally things that will give me nightmares. Like the pictures from it, I've watched a few minutes here and there, and it is It's so disgusting and definitely things that I would somehow work into my dreams that would turn into nightmares.

Its unusual in general for a Hollywood movie but its even unusual for a romantic comedy. So it was nice a nice change and still kind of like an ordinary romantic comedy story, so it really worked, very funny, very good cast, and I'm looking forward to the sequel.###ASSISTANT: Thank you for your time and have a great day!

The supporting cast is really good and adds to the overall film, so it's just not about the romance. Every part of it actually works including the parts where they're not together and it's not about them, it's more about the businesses that are competing.

It is not endearing, not funny. It's sort of bizarre and crass. The humor is much more juvenile than what should be in a romantic comedy. It just didn't work all the way around.

The pace of that particular movie is perfect. It just keeps going. It has a like perfect rhythm to it, even though it does technically slow down at parts.

So, the story itself was not good but it was made more confusing by adding in subtitles to a series that didn't have them before.###USER: and just sort of the way it played out was just pedestrian at best. So even though the technical action scenes were pretty decent, the entire movie, the story line wasn't very believable. It wasn't written all that well. It wasn't acted all that well. It just was a disappointment.###ASSISTANT: Thanks! And, How about the movie The Shape of Water what do you think about that one?###USER: Although I haven't seen that one, the concept is not one that really appeals to me.

{"text": "###USER: Hello! I appreciate a good movie whenever I can.###ASSISTANT: What kind of films do you like to see?###USER: I really like action movies.###ASSISTANT: Why do you like action movies?###USER: They're a great escape. You are almost never thinking about much else besides the movie you're watching, kind of nonstop from start to finish, and they're usually a lot of fun. The action is a lot of fun. A lot of times, the storylines are either fun or intriguing, and all the better if the acting is good, and the action movies can sort of go###USER: both ways with acting, but usually there's enough action to carry things through if the acting's not there.###ASSISTANT: Great, that's really good to know. Now what's a movie you've seen recently that you enjoyed?###USER: recently###USER: Black Panther###ASSISTANT: That's a fun one, did you like it?###USER: I loved it.###ASSISTANT: Why?###USER: It's very high quality action. It is very a lot of fun, actually very inspiring. The story is great, sometimes that suffers in this kind of movie, but this one, the story is great. It's very exciting, and it really is It's a very full complete movie. So, you really get a lot of great acting, great action###USER: and it's just And it's also It really is a lot of fun.###ASSISTANT: That's wonderful. I\"m glad you enjoyed it! Now what kind of movies would you say you generally avoid?###USER: I stay away from a lot of sci-fi movies.###ASSISTANT: Why's that?###USER: They can be good but a lot of them are high concept and the execution will be way off. And I watch a movie and try to understand it as opposed to sort of going with it and a good deal of the Sci-Fi don't make a lot of sense.###ASSISTANT: I see. that makes sense.###USER: Yes.###ASSISTANT: Based on what you've said I'm curious if you've seen Mission Impossible Fallout###USER: Yes.###ASSISTANT: What did you think of it?###USER: I loved it. I love all the Mission: Impossible movies. It's probably my favorite franchise at this point and it was as good as the ones before and it is###USER: Always from start to finish. Usually really well edited so that there is not a lot of extra going on that sort of distracts from the movie. The characters are engaging, and one's that pull you in even though there is always several who are new and unfamiliar to you it doesn't seem to matter. It' just each of the Mission Impossible picks up and introduces you to###USER: You like them and you just go with the story. It's always great.###ASSISTANT: That sounds like a good time! I'm glad you have a series you love.###USER: Yes. I am, too.###ASSISTANT: So have you seen Escape room?###USER: No. That's a little scary for me.###ASSISTANT: Would you ever consider seeing it?###USER: Yeah, like if my friends wanted to see it, I would go with them.###ASSISTANT: Thank you. One last question for you###USER: sure###ASSISTANT: So I know you avoid Sci-fi, but you like action so I'm curious if you've seen Guardians of the Galaxy###USER: I have not. That is###USER: It I don't know, something about it seemed a little too busy, but people really love it, so I feel I'll I will see it at some point and I do like the Marvel movies so I probably will see it at some point. But it does seem a little a little much, I might not love it the way everybody else does, but I I will give it a try."}
{"text": "###USER: Hi there! Movies are my go-to for relaxation.###ASSISTANT: what is your favorite movie?###USER: Oh god, there's so many.###USER: That's a tough choice here. I would have to go with Back to the Future.###ASSISTANT: back to the future, ok all of them or just one of them###USER: All of them, especially the first one. The first one is the one that I saw when I was growing up, so it really left a deep impression on me.###ASSISTANT: what is your favorite part of the movie? the setting or character or other###USER: All the characters, actually. They have their own little quirks and their own little backgrounds and everything. So, that's very cool. And especially, well, all the sets, you know? It's It's built like a real place. So, it feels real, too, if that makes sense. Like it's not like it's made up for the movie.###ASSISTANT: do you think they predicted the future well###USER: Yes, although we don't have flying cars yet. But we have self-driving ones.###ASSISTANT: would you like to have a flying car yourself###USER: Yes, it'd be very convenient until everybody has one and now the air spaces are too busy.###ASSISTANT: when do you think those might come out###USER: Oh, boy! We are looking maybe in the next 50 years. I know they are working on it but before it is publicly available, it is going to be a long time.###ASSISTANT: that would be for awhile, what about characters, who do you like the most in the movie###USER: Doc Brown, the professor. He plays a really good character in these It just worked out really well the way that they cast him, and he's really into character. Like it feels like he was made for the role.###ASSISTANT: the professor? can you relate well with him###USER: Yeah.###USER: Yeah, I like to tinker. Not that I invent things, but it does speak to me.###ASSISTANT: ok if you like to invent things what would you like to invent or improve on###USER: Better way to get your power.###USER: And if you think even Back to the Future, they had this little mini nuclear reactor for your house. That'd be awesome.###ASSISTANT: like alternative energy?###USER: Yes. Solar power is nice but it's still limited on it's form depending on the area that you leave.###ASSISTANT: thats very innovative yes, what about a scene you didnt really enjoy from the movie###USER: The scene that I really liked was the one where he eventually gets back like the the whole suspense to last, you know, 15 20 minutes when they are building up trying to get him back to his own time.###ASSISTANT: why do you like it###USER: It's suspenseful. It pulls you into the movie. Like the first time I saw it, I was on the ends of my seat and I was almost screaming at the screen, you know?###ASSISTANT: where did you watch it, in the theater?###USER: No. I watched it at home. I wasn't old enough to go to the theater.###ASSISTANT: ah ok, that must have been very memorable scene as a child###USER: Yes. And it was a good movie to watch when we're young.###ASSISTANT: can you share with me some movies you just dont like###USER: I hate sports movies. They just don't interest me, I think they're boring. If I wanted to watch something sports, I would watch it myself.###USER: Like I watch like real sports, not a sports movie.###ASSISTANT: ok there are many movies involving football players and tennis players, you are not interested in anyone of those?###USER: If I have other options, then I would watch something else. If I had to pick, you know, if you go to movies, and you get to pick between three shows, then of those three movies and one of them is a sports movie, it's an automatic out.###ASSISTANT: ok have you seen one like match point for example###USER: No.###ASSISTANT: how about other sports movies have you seen any###USER: Yeah, I've seen a few. I did enjoy Rocky. The first couple of Rocky movies were good. The Blind Side, which is a sports movie, but it's more a drama. And Space Jam, of course. Everybody loves Space Jam.###ASSISTANT: the blind side and rocky would you say they are heavier on drama or the sports element###USER: Drama.###ASSISTANT: ok would that be a good reason why you are ok with them###USER: I think so. Yeah, I think that's a safe thing safe thing to say. The sports takes a background, with the drama to foreground."}

I really enjoy watching movies.###ASSISTANT: What kinds of movies do you like?###USER: I like Science fiction, thrillers, some horror movies, dramas, and a few comedies I think. Mainly from childhood I guess.###ASSISTANT: Well tell me why do you like science fiction movies?###USER: Well, I think the obvious one being that they show you something you don't experience or never seen before in, you know, our reality. And often times they are a template or it's a way to talk about our reality through some other just, you know, extra worldly imaginative world that the writer or director or whatever creates.###USER: And it's it's fun just to be able to leave and visit a different world, I guess.###ASSISTANT: cool, what is your favorite movie?###USER: In that genre, or overall?###ASSISTANT: Overall###USER: Ooh, that would be tough.###USER: Well, the first one that comes in mind oddly is not science fiction, but the movie Seven mainly because of how well paced it is I think. Yeah, and indie.###ASSISTANT: Interesting, is there a movie you did not like?###USER: Well, recently the new Jurassic World movie, Fallen Kingdom I think is the sequel. I didn't I didn't really like the first Jurassic World but I I just don't understand why they're as popular as they are when none of the Jurassic Parks except for the first one has been really very good###USER: and this one is I don't even really remember much about it other than I was kind of bored by it, and things just didn't make any sense.###ASSISTANT: Ok, then have you seen the movie Logan###USER: Yes, and I very much enjoyed it.###ASSISTANT: What is it about this kinds of movies that you like or dislike?###USER: About movies like Logan?###ASSISTANT: Yes###USER: Well, it's a tough question that'll answer cuz I think the reason I like Logan was it was it's a superhero movie, but it doesn't feel like a superhero movie and it feels very different than any of the others. So, it's things I like about it is while it's not are not the things I like about other movies. It's very different and it's and it's kind of a town movie, but it felt like a western###USER: Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is iconic. And the fact that they go they went rated R with it really, I think, helped the movie feel more impactful. And that character actually reach the levels that that of the love of why people like that character."}

So it's kind of like club all together into a movie. Like splicing 10 different parts together into a movie, and here you go, here's the movie with kind of a plot.###ASSISTANT: thanks for sharing. this is a bit of a tangent, but did u watch black panther?###USER: I did not.

It seemed too contrived.###ASSISTANT: What about that kind of movie didn't you like?###USER: I just thought they made it up as they went along. It's kind of slow in some parts.

Movies are a great source of entertainment for me.###ASSISTANT: What kinds of movies do you like?###USER: Pretty much everything except like Hallmark type movies or really really cheesy rom coms or family movies and some documentaries I don't some. If some the documentary is really dry, I can't get into it, it puts me to sleep.###ASSISTANT: Is there something specific you can always watch?###USER: As a movie, or a genre?###ASSISTANT: Genre###USER: Probably action movies. I mean it's always fun to watch things blow up, you don't have to put much thought into it but so I guess that's the easiest answer to give.###ASSISTANT: Alright, how about a movie you liked?###USER: In that genre, or overall?###ASSISTANT: Over all please###USER: Well, the most-recent one I liked and isn't an action movie, really, is Paddington 2. Which is a very much a that kind of cheesy family movie I said I don't really like. But it's just enough, and maybe it's cuz of the political climate we're in and everything. So cynical and negative that something that joyous and positive, I enjoyed. Whereas if###USER: Things were going better in politics or the world. I mean I'd see it as that but yeah, I would answer Paddington 2.###ASSISTANT: Interesting, is there a movie you did not like?###USER: Can't think of anything recently.###USER: Well, there's a movie I always give which is a movie called Spartan by David Mamet, or at least it's written by David Mamet. And it's laughable how he's known for writing and very kind of his dialog and characters and I thought it was somebody making fun of his style, but it wasn't.###USER: It was all in earnest and it it was just awful It made me laugh throughout the whole thing, how bad it was.###ASSISTANT: Ok, then have you seen the movie The Martian ?###USER: Matt Damon? Yes. And read the book.###ASSISTANT: What is it about these kinds of movies that you like or dislike?###USER: Well, for that movie, it's kind of for the movie I There was a question before where you're asking about what movie I could or genre I could always watch. That's always going to be Die Hard. And I think The Martian is very similar in that it's a man trying to outwit his circumstances. In Die Hard, it's he's just an every-day Joe cop guy###USER: In The Martian, you know, he's a scientist, really smart guy. But it's seeing him be very confident figuring out in a very dangerous situation that how to survive, and that was very fun to watch.###ASSISTANT: Wonderful. thank you for sharing. Good bye."}

I can watch it at any time, rewatch it, and it always puts me in a good mood.###ASSISTANT: Great. Now can you name for me a movie you didn't particularly enjoy?###USER: Sure, Ugly Truth that's just a bad movie it's a they built it as a romantic comedy but really it was sort of like a gross out of comedy and it was definitely surrounding a relationship but it was just bad. The acting which they had good actors in it but the writing was terrible, the direction was terrible, what they were going for was anything but what a romantic comedy gives off. It was not endearing it was not something###USER: that you root for. And what they made that they thought were jokes were not funny.###ASSISTANT: I see. that's very helpful.

It's an animated movie, which can be very juvenile. But this one was very easy to like as an adult. It's just funny and cute, it definitely worked. So, I'm definitely interested in seeing a second one.###ASSISTANT: Okay great, that's very good to know. Now what about Batman v. Superman?

Have you watched the movie Dunkirk ?###USER: Yes.###ASSISTANT: did you like it?###USER: I thought the Nolan does really well with sound design and manipulating you through sound and visual, but he broke it up the narrative of it and it was it was unnecessarily hard to follow. It made sense by the end, but it didn't help the story, and I thought it took away from what he was trying to get across.\u00a0###USER: And he kept taking me out of the movie, whereas some might say even Wright Ryan that is very impassive, I thought Don Cork was the opposite of that except for the sounds and it was shot well. But there is very little character development, I can't name you any other characters or really any of the stories of the characters were.###USER: So, I would say I'm kind of in the middle on that movie, but slightly to the negative.###ASSISTANT: Alright.

But they really nailed the cast, and even though the movie itself got attention for the true laugh out loud moments, some of the more quieter moments, the sort of humorous, maybe not laugh out loud things were some of my favorite parts of the movie.

It feels like the storyline isn't there, like it feels like it compromises in some ways. It just isn't as just interesting to watch.

It's like I'ts perfect. It's a mockumentary style film and they are mocking the dog show world. So, the dog show world that they show is like a carbon copy of the real thing because it's inherently funny, so they don't have to really max with it. And a lot of the player they it there's a script for the movie but it's also ad libed.###USER: It's just hilarious. It's so original.###USER: So much, so different, and just so funny. It makes you laugh every time you watch it.###ASSISTANT: ok, would you say you enjoy satire?###USER: Yeah.###ASSISTANT: ok, can you name a film you dislike?###USER: Sure, Bounty Hunter.###ASSISTANT: why didn't you like that movie?###USER: It was supposed to be a comedy, and not only was it not funny, it was confusing what they were going for. I think it was miscast.###USER: It's Jennifer Aniston and I can't even think of his name, but somebody who I don't really care for. But I do like Jennifer usually, and it wasn't a good fit for her. Neither role really fit the actor, like they were sort of playing against type in both roles. I think it was kind of supposed to be almost like a almost like a buddy comedy, but or Cuz it was really focused on two people, but not really buddies, but they were in conflict. It wasn't funny.###USER: It kind of had like a more dramatic feel to it because it wasn't funny. It was just It was odd. Really.###ASSISTANT: was the acting bad?###USER: It wasn't great. It was not great.###ASSISTANT: ok, can you tell me have you watched the movie the shawshank redemption?###USER: Oh, yes.###ASSISTANT: do you like that movie?###USER: It's a excellent movie.###ASSISTANT: ok, what about the movie did you enjoy?###USER: It really has a different feel to it. It's despite them being, you know, prisoners, they create very endearing characters who you rooting for, who you want to see have a better life. It is a You're transported to a different time so you can sort of capture what was going on better.###USER: It very moving, it very and and it's very touching which usually does not happen with something that's sort of a prison drama. I don't you ever really view them as true prisoners some of whom shouldn't really have gotten as steep of sentences as they do or like somebody who walks who was there far too long for what it sounded like he was in for and then couldn't live in the real world having been locked up so long. So, it's it's it's a it's just a it's a excellent film.###USER: with amazing acting, wonderful direction and it's just It's very special. It it really is. It's it's one of those wonder you look back and you wonder why didn't want to win Oscar."}

Right of the bat, smart guy. Hey, I love the fact that they're based in real life. That definitely gives a sense of realism to the film.

Sleepless in Seattle's one of my favorite movies.###ASSISTANT: Can you tell me the things about that type of movie you remember liking?###USER: Sure. Sleepless in Seattle is fantastic, especially because of the actors and the writing.

It is entertaining, but it probably has The Avengers movies are probably are not my favorite superhero movies, strictly because it's such a large cast of characters. So there's a lot going on###USER: it ends up being longer than I wish it would be. But in general, it's an easy thing to watch, and it's at the very least somewhat enjoyable, if not very enjoyable. Sometimes it can be very enjoyable.###ASSISTANT: I see. what else about that type of movie did you not like in particular?###USER: You know, I really just don't like I think the length. It doesn't feel as sort of tight and edited as the better superhero movies are. It just feels like it it's sort of going on. And also that one, the first one too, they can get a little complicated. You know, I think they're trying to offer something completely different, and sometimes it's just not the most simple story line,###USER: and it works against the movie being more enjoyable###ASSISTANT: All right. Interesting. Are there types of movies you don't like? If so, tell me what about those types you don't like?###USER: Sure. I don't like horror movies. I just don't like scaring myself and got so going to a horror movie is certainly going to do that. I know it's fake and for me to sort of get through it I have to almost tell myself that it's fake which defeats the purpose of going. Most people who like horror films like being scared so I I don't like being scared. It can cause me to have nightmares.

It is actually a take off of a Shakespeare novel, and so the lead character is undercover impersonating her twin brother, and basically falls in love with another student who doesn't know that she's posing as a guy. And it's just a lot of fun. The actors are extremely likable.###USER: At the time, they were\u00a0somewhat unknown. Amanda Bynes, who was the star, was not unknown, but the male lead, Channing Tatum was very unknown at the time, who's now a superstar. And it's just It's It's a lot of fun.

Some sci-fi doesn't work for me.###ASSISTANT: What do you not like about Sci-Fi movies?###USER: I don't dislike all sci-fi movies, but it's kind of particular which ones I like. I think the storylines can get very very complicated in a way that's almost unnecessary, like they should channel their focus more into one aspect or three aspects instead of you know, trying to tackle 20. And then sometimes I think about sci-fi, it's just you have to really stick the landing in the movie and###USER: If you don't, it's like a really It just doesn't come off well. So because it's such a It's sort of a concept movie where it's not It's not based in reality, there's a lot going on. When it's lacking, the whole thing falls apart. So if it doesn't come together on almost every way the way other movies don't need to, maybe there's a bad character, a plot point that doesn't really make sense, but it's no big deal. In sci-fi, it has to all work###USER: In order for it all to make sense and for the movie to be good, because already you're all in a alternate reality.###ASSISTANT: What movie did you last watch that was disappointing?###USER: Any movie? I mean, last I could tell you a sci fi movie that's disappointing is Thirteenth Floor. That's terrible.###USER: But if you're talking about any movie in general that was bad I recently watched A Good Day to Die Hard and that was not good.###ASSISTANT: Have you seen Ant Man?###USER: I have.###ASSISTANT: Did you like or dislike that movie?###USER: I liked the Ant Man.

It's up there like my top three favorite movies of all time.###ASSISTANT: what did you like about these movies?###USER: I liked Avengers: Infinity War because it's a superhero movie, of course. It had really everything that I enjoyed from the past 10 years of the Marvel Universe, cuz Iron Man's my favorite hero in the Marvel Universe, and then Spider-Man's next to him. And it was pretty amazing, the storyline was pretty good, it hit your emotional cores when it gets there, and the character growth###USER: What was going on was pretty good, too. The Town and I loved it so much because it's like it's a bank heist movie, but it's like really good. It was written really well. And the direction of the from the director was pretty solid.

I expected like a Deadpool kind of movie, where you see Venom doing his most###USER: Bad things like, he's not a hero, he's anti hero, but at the same time the movie made it show like he was a super hero which it was not cuz that's not was the picture was in the comics and that the and when you realize the movie watch the movie and it's just like oh, just a love story and it's something that basically not it was close to what I wanted but it didn't that that's what I really###USER: liked about this movie. Like Venom is you think about It's just It's way better than the Spider-Man 3 movie, Venom. I just didn't like the way they teased Venom in saying, oh look, you can get this anti-hero as a movie, get everybody all high, but then when it comes out, like oh, it's just, you know, it's a love story.

Movies are a great source of entertainment for me.###ASSISTANT: What type of movies do you like and why?###USER: My favorite types of movies are drama, documentary, some action adventure, and a little bit of fantasy mixed in, primarily###ASSISTANT: Can you name a particular movie you like?###USER: I like I like The Matrix, the whole the whole trilogy of The Matrix because the story there was a little bit of Sci Fi and it related to real life and just a new perspective.###ASSISTANT: Please give at least 2 reasons why you like that movie.###USER: I like all the Matrix movies. The first one was like an entryway into what the Matrix is and the story about basically society being a game. And then I mean, just the sci-fi aspects of it it's like fantasy mixed with###USER: I mean, it's It's hard to describe in a way, cuz it's it It was done in a way that was not like anything else before. So on another note, I like the way the characters were created and how they were put in place. It was very good actors that were chosen for the movies.###USER: Well then that's that's pretty much it, just an awesome, freaking trilogy.###ASSISTANT: Can you name a particular movie you dislike?###USER: Let's see. I didn't really care for for Blues or anything like like Dirty Dancing. I wasn't really###USER: keen on that kind of kind of movie because like those dancing movies and music movies don't really grab me and Like High School Musical, Chicago, stuff like that. I mean Chicago was okay. It was I could deal with that one. It was more artsy.###USER: But movies like musical movies that are too cheesy, I can't get into those. And also because it's just It's just too cookie cutter and too mainstream. It needs to have some art to it.###ASSISTANT: Do you like the movie Guardians of the Galaxy ?###USER: I saw the first one, and I saw a little bit of the second one, but it's It was all right. I'm more I just like the basic superhero movies###ASSISTANT: Please give at least 2 reasons why you like or dislike this movie.###USER: I don't like the inclusion of like comedy and how the comedy was used. I think it should have been more serious. Like the original Spider-Man with Tobey Maguire was more serious than Spider-Man: Homecoming. Even the second one was a little bit more There was some comedy in it that was just not right for that comic style, so###USER: And another reason is, I just didn't like how the story was written for the movie, like expected of the director, and they They could have written it a little bit more based around the comic book instead of how it was.###ASSISTANT: Have you seen the movie Halloween ?###USER: I saw the original one, but I didn't see the new one.###ASSISTANT: Although you have not seen the new Halloween, have you heard of it?###USER: Yes, I've heard of it.

I'm probably not going to go see it in theaters, but I wouldn't mind seeing that, versus the one that was made by I think Rob Zombie. That was That was a totally different perspective of it, which I actually did like that one too, so we'll see.###ASSISTANT: Do you like the movie A Star Is Born ?###USER: I haven't seen that.###ASSISTANT: Although you have not seen it, have you heard of it?###USER: I think I have heard of it. I think I've heard of that title, but that's it.###ASSISTANT: Do you think you would like to see it?###USER: Probably not. I'd have to look into it a little bit more to see what's it's about stuff so###ASSISTANT: Have you seen the movie Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl ?###USER: I haven't seen that one.###ASSISTANT: Have you seen the movie The Matrix ?###USER: Yes, I've seen that. I was just talking about that earlier.###ASSISTANT: Please give at least 2 reasons why you like or dislike this movie.###USER: Oh, I like it for the story, how they present the characters, and I also like it because of the way that they talk about civilization and how it was based on you know It was all pre-scripted. Reality is not what you think. So they kind of gave a new perspective on the truth of reality and society and stuff."}

Yeah.###ASSISTANT: I see.###ASSISTANT: Can you name a particular movie you like?###USER: Full Metal Jacket###ASSISTANT: What did you like about that movie?###USER: Well, in beginning it has an excellent boot camp scene, half of the movie is like boot camp and it's just intense. And then the second part of it is like that they mentioned it in the film just the duality of man kind of concepts of and also the whole silliness of war almost how stupid it is.###ASSISTANT: Cool.###ASSISTANT: Can you tell me a movie you did not like?###USER: I haven't watched a movie I didn't like in a while. Okay, I didn't like the Jack Ryan movie.###ASSISTANT: How come you did not like it?###USER: It didn't feel like an actual Jack Ryan film. And I say the actual Jack Ryan films referring to the Hunt for Red October, the Patriot Games, and other films like that that came out in the '80s and '90s. Jack Ryan felt really It felt like it wanted to be a Bourne film and not which is just straight up action designed for people with short attention spans.###ASSISTANT: I see. How did you feel about Mission Impossible?###USER: I don't know. Mission: Impossible, you know what you're going to get with it because you've got Tom Cruise in it, and he does know how to make a good action film. But it was really standard Hollywood fare.###USER: So it was okay. I kind of liked it.###ASSISTANT: ok. how about Dumb and dumber? how'd you feel about that?###USER: Oh, that's a stupid film. I disliked it.###USER: Definitely not the kind of movie I I enjoy.###ASSISTANT: How come you did not like it?###USER: It's It's in the title. It's Dumb and Dumber. It was a dumb movie. They just That's the kind of movie I walk out on.###ASSISTANT: how come?###USER: It's not like a smart comedy. It's more designed for It's like movie designed for teenagers, not for adult. It's just stupid.###USER: It's not a thinking film. It doesn't have anything I can think about.###USER: If I don't want to think about something, I meditate."}

It was just the same old Whereas some sequels are a whole new story that's interesting, this just seemed like a cash grab, as they would say.###ASSISTANT: ah. i understand. have you heard of the movie deadpool###USER: Yes.###ASSISTANT: have u seen it###USER: No.###ASSISTANT: how about the matrix###USER: Yes, I love that movie.###ASSISTANT: lovely. what do u like about these kinds of movies###USER: The story line is based upon like the real world, but then it's reinvented to be something that technically is impossible.

{"text": "###USER: Hey! Watching movies is one of my favorite pastimes.###ASSISTANT: What are some kinds of movies you like?###USER: One of my favorite kinds is action movies.###ASSISTANT: Why's that?###USER: They're The action is a lot of fun. Even though it's it's not something that you want to see in real life. It's a ton of fun on screen. They tend to be like sort of like non-stop, start to finish or great escape. And, usually if the story is good in good action movie the story is descent so if somebody getting saved###USER: skewed or they are on some mission to help a country or whatever the case may be and it's usually something you can root for so it's a good time.###ASSISTANT: That's great. What other kinds of movies do you like?###USER: I also like Like similar to action movies, I also like superhero movies, which are a little bit different than action movies, but I do like those as well.###ASSISTANT: I see. What's a movie you've seen that you really liked###USER: One of my favorite action movies is definitely Mr. & Mrs. Smith.###ASSISTANT: what's so good about it that it's your favorite?###USER: That's one that has excellent cast, really great acting, and it's one that pairs action and comedy really well. Some All the great things that you get of action movie, you know, the action, the whatever, the fighting, that those kinds of scenes that are very exciting, but also they do such a great job with the comedy. So, it's a really entertaining movie from start to finish. But###USER: It's not all highly charged. There's a There's a a lot of levity, a lot of laughter, throughout.###ASSISTANT: That sounds fun! Now, switching gears, what kinds of movies do you dislike?###USER: I don't really like sci-fi movies.###ASSISTANT: Why not? Aren't they very popular?###USER: Sci-Fi movies are very popular. For me, Sci-Fi can be a little too high concept. And it's not always well thought out or well executed. There's a lot of times where I watch a Sci-Fi, and I'll think this doesn't make much sense. And so, it's hard to like something when it doesn't really sort of carry through on whatever claim it's making in the beginning. Sci-Fi really struggles with that. So, if they do it well###ASSISTANT: okay, that's pretty reasonable. So what's a movie you've seen that you disliked?###USER: Like The Thirteenth Floor was not a good one. That's one where the concept Like till this day I still don't understand what they were trying to do. So It was interesting, it was a very good cast, it was a well acted movie, but the concept and what they were going for was so confusing. And it wasn't confusing the entire###USER: movie, but it was confusing probably midway through till the end so that when you're done with the movie, you're looking at the person next you thinking do you understand what just happened cuz I did I don't I didn't get it. And and that's one where I've talked to other people who saw and they're like I didn't get it either. So, it's just the confusion that comes with sci-fi. It ends up not being the best movie going experience because I guess it does great conversation, but it's not great to###USER: our conversation when we're all wondering what they were trying to go for, cuz they didn't pull it off very well.###ASSISTANT: So it's important for you to get movies so you can talk about them afterwords?###USER: It's good if you can talk about them afterwards, but it is just important to get it, so that it's sort of a satisfying movie-going experience, rather than a confusing one. You want to go to the movies, enjoy it, and be happy you went, instead of thinking, \"I could've stayed home for all that.###ASSISTANT: I see. Now I\"m curious if you have seen or heard of Avengers Age of Ultron###USER: I have not seen it, but I have heard of it. It's one that I would watch. I've watched Avengers movies before. Like I said, I do like superhero movies. But the Avengers movies are not my favorite. They have so many characters, and so much going on, that while it can be mostly entertaining, it's usually just a lot it's just a lot going on. And it's just It's okay. It's just not my first choice.###ASSISTANT: I see. Thank you.###USER: You're welcome.###ASSISTANT: I've got one more question if that's okay?###USER: Sure.###ASSISTANT: Have you seen or heard of Holmes and Watson?###USER: Yes. I have as long as I have the second movie in the series. Yes, I've seen it.###ASSISTANT: I didn't know it was a series. What did you think of it?###USER: It wasn't as good as the first one, but in general it's a really good paring between Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law, that really works. And he's a great as Sherlock Holmes, and it has a good feel for it. The comedic tone is great. The I would say the biggest problem with the movie in general is just it's script isn't as good as the first one. So, maybe they need###USER: like take more time to really come up with a good story that presents well on-screen. But you can still come away liking the movie because the characters are enjoyable."}

What kind of movies do you like?###USER: I like romantic comedies a lot.###ASSISTANT: Why do you like this kind of movie?###USER: I really love comedies, so I like the aspect that it's you know, funny, lighthearted, but I also love romances, so the combination is great. You basically get a happy ending in all of the movies, and it's usually just a feel good movie. It's a good time, and it's a nice escape.###ASSISTANT: Can you name a particular romantic comedy that you like?###USER: Sure, like The Holiday is one of my absolute favorites.###ASSISTANT: What are the 2 things that you like about this movie?###USER: The cast of the movie is fantastic, like couldn't have been better, and it's Jude Law and Cameron Diaz and it just It's It's It's so good. And the The The script The storyline of the whole movie is so well done. It's so well written, but it's also It's much more original###USER: than we usually get in a romantic comedy. It has two love stories in it, not one. It has some unexpected heartwarming aspects to it involving other characters, as well. It's just a delight.###ASSISTANT: Can you name a movie that you dislike?###USER: A romantic comedy that I dislike?###USER: Thou Be True, it's terrible.###ASSISTANT: What are the 2 things that you dislike about this movie?###USER: It was So part of the problem was how it was billed. It was billed as a romantic comedy. That's how they advertised it, that's how they showed it, and that's how they acted like it was going to be when they started the movie. But it was really more of a gross out comedy, which was kind of popular at the time, I guess. And So you went in expecting a romantic comedy, and you What was really happening was sort of like taking comedy to the extreme in a very###USER: funny and sort of gross out juvenile manner. It was a mess. The second thing I really hate about it really the lead actor. Gerard Butler is sorely miscast. He just is not good for romantic comedies at all. He doesn't pull off any aspect of what you want out of a romantic He's not like good at lighthearted. He's not funny. And I guess he's good looking, but it doesn't really###USER: It's not like that in a handsome way I guess.###ASSISTANT: Other than the casting of Gerald Butler, can you name a third reason?###USER: Sure. Just in general, the movie itself is poorly written. It's like it was###USER: I guess, I think probably trying too hard to be too many things, it certainly wasn't a romantic comedy and it was written in a way that one, I didn't laugh once, and two, the comedy they were going for was a wrong kind of comedy for romantic comedy.###ASSISTANT: Do you like the movie Black Klansman?###USER: Oh, I haven't seen that yet, but that's That's got to be a good one.###ASSISTANT: Do you like the movie Spotlight?###USER: I mean it's an excellent film, it's not something that I would re-watch again but it's an important film and really well done.###ASSISTANT: Can you give a couple of reasons why you like this movie?###USER: It is###USER: a really good ensemble cast. Sometimes it's hard to do an ensemble movie because there could be weak links throughout the cast, but this is one that is all around solid and the screenplay is exceptional. It is really well written, really well done and really captures the the true story that it was writing about and the###USER: And it pulls off what they were trying to accomplish in terms of capturing the importance of a story that they needed to tell.###ASSISTANT: Do you like the movie Jurassic World?###USER: I haven't see it, but I But that kind of movie is okay. I have seen the original Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park 2. And i do like the general feel of them, but those can tend to be a bit scary too, so I'm not sure if Jurassic World would be good for me, but I would see it.###ASSISTANT: Last question: can you give a couple of reasons why you like this movie?###USER: I like action movies, and it's basically an action movie, so it has that sort of aspect of being exciting and kind of edge of your seat and you know, keeping you going from start to finish, so that's good. And then I do like the cast that they have in Jurassic World. I think they sort of I think they nailed it for sort of that sort of summer block###USER: so that's always great, and all of the Jurassic Park movies have fantastic visual effects, so it's a big budget movie. But it's big budget for a reason, they really get the feel of the dinosaurs and everything is so much more realistic than you'd think. And it really helps to carry off what they're going for in a movie.###ASSISTANT: Thank you. You give the best critiques! Good night.###USER: Good night."}

And why do you avoid that kind of movie?###USER: I usually avoid something that doesn't entertain me because I don't want to be bored or fall asleep in movies.

If it's like thriller or horror movie, I don't want like to be scared cuz I can get scared easily and get nightmares.###USER: real bad dreams###ASSISTANT: That's fair.

Now given what you've said, I'm curious if you have seen or heard of Aquaman###USER: I've heard of Aquaman. I didn't see it, but I want to because I'm a big Jason Momoa fan, and I heard it was pretty good, better than anyone expected.

Probably when when I'm able to rent it or buy it on Blu-ray.###ASSISTANT: I see, thank you. How about Deadpool 2?###USER: I love Deadpool 2. It's really funny.

I didn't say it was better than the first one but it was still fun to see and I had a great time watching it.###ASSISTANT: Do you like when movies are comic book accurate?###USER: Yeah, I do. It makes###USER: Well, I sort of do. Because if it's comic book accurate and you've read the comics, you already know what's going to happen. But when they change a little, I don't mind it.

{"text": "###USER: Greetings! Movies always manage to capture my attention.###ASSISTANT: What kinds of movies do you like?###USER: I like movies that are more like art house films. One of my favorite movies is The Fall. I also like horror movies and just weird movies in general.###ASSISTANT: Well, tell me why do you like art house films?###USER: I like them because usually there's a lot of symbolism and there's a lot of thought that goes into every scene usually things are there for a reason and put there for purpose unlike your typical action film that doesn't really have that.###ASSISTANT: cool, what was your favorite movie again?###USER: The Fall.###ASSISTANT: alright, Why is that your favorite movie###USER: Because I love the cinematography. It's beautifully filmed. It was filmed, I think in over 20 countries. It was filmed by a director called Tarsem Singh, if I say his name right. And I believe he financed most of it. It was sort of his pet project, and I like the story. But it's just beautifully###USER: A particular movie, I can't think off the top of my head, but in general I'm not a huge fan of comedies. Well, actually I can think of one. I don't really care for like Superbad or movies like that.###ASSISTANT: Interesting, is there a movie you do not like###ASSISTANT: oh, Why not?###USER: I just think they're stupid, they're not that interesting to me, and they bore me. It's not my kind of comedy.###ASSISTANT: Ok, then have you seen the movie The Martian###USER: I did see that movie.###ASSISTANT: What is it about this kind of movies that you like or dislike?###USER: The Martian was a little slow, I will have to say. It wasn't terrible or anything. I like sci-fi movies, but it was just slow. It got a little boring in parts. If I was going to pick a sci-fi movie that came out around that same time period, I would've picked Interstellar. I think it had a better story and more meaning. And just was more interesting###USER: Although, I believe the motion was more to the book and not necessarily I wouldn't say to the book, but to how it would surely be to be stuck up on more by yourself eventually.###ASSISTANT: Wonderful. thank you for sharing. Good bye.###USER: Goodbye"}

Movies like Suicide Squad, they struggle. I think they kind of fall into that Spider-Man thing where they throw too much at you or into their movies, and the tone is very dark, but Wonder Woman was not that. It was very kind of felt like a Marvel movie a little bit. Had a little optimism to it.###ASSISTANT: Thank you for that###USER: Mhm.###ASSISTANT: Goodbye"}

The third stars a completely different actor who is not as charismatic as Macaulay is, so leaving the movie to just him was a problem. He could not carry off the starring role in the same way, so the first two Like almost everybody else, I consider the first two be Home Alone movies and ignore the rest.###ASSISTANT: Thank you for your help and have a wonderful day!###USER: You, too. Thank you."}
